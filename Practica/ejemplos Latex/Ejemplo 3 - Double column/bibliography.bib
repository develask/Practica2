	Abstract = {A well-studied approach to the design of voting rules views them as maximum likelihood estimators; given votes that are seen as noisy estimates of a true ranking of the alternatives, the rule must reconstruct the most likely true ranking. We argue that this is too stringent a requirement, and instead ask: How many votes does a voting rule need to reconstruct the true ranking? We define the family of pairwise-majority consistent rules, and show that for all rules in this family the number of samples required from the Mallows noise model is logarithmic in the number of alternatives, and that no rule can do asymptotically better (while some rules like plurality do much worse). Taking a more normative point of view, we consider voting rules that surely return the true ranking as the number of samples tends to infinity (we call this property accuracy in the limit); this allows us to move to a higher level of abstraction. We study families of noise models that are parametrized by distance functions, and find voting rules that are accurate in the limit for all noise models in such general families. We characterize the distance functions that induce noise models for which pairwise-majority consistent rules are accurate in the limit, and provide a similar result for another novel family of position-dominance consistent rules. These characterizations capture three well-known distance functions.},

This book offers a collection of papers in memory of Leontief by his students and close colleagues. The first part, 'Reflections on Input-Output Economics', focuses upon Leontief as a person and scholar as well as his personal contributions to economics. It includes contributions by Nobel Laureate Paul A. Samuelson who shares his memories of a young Professor Leontief at Harvard and ends with the last joint interview with Wassily and his wife, to date previously unpublished. The second part, 'Perspectives of Input-Output Economics', includes theoretical and empirical research inspired by Leontief's work and offers a wide-ranging sample of the state of interindustry economics, a field Leontief founded. This is a strong collection likely to appeal to a wide range of professionals in universities, government, industry and international organizations.},

@book{diaconis1988group,
	Abstract = {The purpose of this nice little book is to show how the mathematical theory of group representations can be used to solve very concrete problems in probability and statistics. It is mainly concerned with noncommutative finite groups. Let us describe two of its typical simple examples.

The first one is card shuffling. A deck of cards is repeatedly shuffled. For instance, a random card is transposed with the top one, or two cards chosen at random with each hand are transposed (one can also cut about half the pack and riffle the two packets together). How many shuffles are necessary in order to bring the deck of cards close to random? Repeated shuffling is modeled as convolving a fixed probability measure on the symmetric group. The problem is to find the rate of convergence of these convolution powers to the uniform distribution. Group representations turns the analysis of convolutions into the more manageable analysis of products. This leads to very explicit new results (in Chapter 3).

The second example comes from classical analysis of variance. Let $X=\{1,\cdots,n\}\times\{1,\cdots,m\}$. Consider real data $x_{ij}$, $(i,j)\in X$, which are collected in a two-way layout. The rows represent the levels of a factor and the columns the levels of a second factor. The order in which the rows (and the columns) appear is not of any significance. Therefore it is natural to introduce the group $G=X_n\times S_m$ acting on $X$. Let $L(X)$ be the set of functions on $X$. A set of data is an element of this space. Let $L(X)=V_0\oplus V_1\oplus V_2\oplus V_3$ be the decomposition of $L(X)$ into irreducible components under the action of $G$. Then projection on $V_0$ gives the grand mean, the projection on $V_1$ gives the influence of rows, that a $V_2$ gives the influence of columns, and that a $V_3$ gives what is left over (residuals). We just recover the usual ANOVA. But, when this spectral analysis is applied to less standard kinds of data, it gives in a systematic way a decomposition into factors which is not so obvious to guess.

This book contains 9 chapters. Chapters 2 and 7 develop, in a very friendly way and from first principles, all the tools of group representations which are needed. Chapters 3 and 4 deal with random walks on groups and study problems of the same kind as the card shuffling example above. The other chapters give statistical applications (such as data analysis as in the second example above, partially ranked data, data with values in homogeneous spaces, models). The book contains a very useful annotated bibliography.

This book is remarkable. On the one hand it is a research book (most of the material appears in book form here for the first time), using tools from one of the main active fields in ``pure mathematics''. On the other hand, it is very clear and self-contained. Both the pure mathematician and the applied statistician will find pleasure and excitement in reading it. The text is full of attractive examples. It contains many open questions and I am sure that it will be the starting point for new research on the subject. },

@article{citeulike:8461510,
	Abstract = { A new psychological law, called the law of comparative judgment, is presented with some of its special applications in the measurement of psychological values. This law is applicable not only to the comparison of physical stimulus intensities but also to qualitative comparative judgments, such as those of excellence of specimens in an educational scale. It should be possible also to verify it on comparative judgments which involve simultaneous and successive contrast. The law is stated as {follows:[Equation} omitted]in which S-sub(1) and S-sub(2) are the psychological scale values of the two compared stimuli; x-sub(12) is the sigma value corresponding to the proportion of judgments p-sub(1) > p-sub(2). ς-sub(1) is the discriminal dispersion of stimulus R-sub(1) and ς-sub(2) is the dispersion of stimulus R-sub(2). r is the correlation between the discriminal deviations of R-sub(1) and R-sub(2) in the same judgment. This law is basic for work on Weber's and Fechner's laws, applies to the judgments of a single observer who compares a series of stimuli by the method of paired comparisons when no "equal" judgments are allowed, and is a rational equation for the method of constant stimuli. The law is then applied to five cases each of which involves different assumptions and different degrees of simplification of the law for practical use. The weighting of the observation equations is discussed because the observation equations obtained with the five cases are not of the same reliability and hence should not be equally weighted.

	Abstract = {This paper performs a comparison of several methods for Kemeny rank aggregation (104 algorithms and combinations thereof in total) originating in social choice theory, machine learning, and theoretical computer science, with the goal of establishing the best trade-offs between search time and performance. We find that, for this theoretically NP-hard task, in practice the problems span three regimes: strong consensus, weak consensus, and no consensus. We make specific recommendations for each, and propose a computationally fast test to distinguish between the regimes. In spite of the great variety of algorithms, there are few classes that are consistently Pareto optimal. In the most interesting regime, the integer program exact formulation, local search algorithms and the approximate version of a theoretically exact branch and bound algorithm arise as strong contenders.},

@article{Nawaz1983,
	Abstract = {In a general flow-shop situation, where all the jobs must pass through all the machines in the same order, certain heuristic algorithms propose that the jobs with higher total process time should be given higher priority than the jobs with less total process time. Based on this premise, a simple algorithm is presented in this paper, which produces very good sequences in comparison with existing heuristics. The results of the proposed algorithm have been compared with the results from 15 other algorithms in an independent study by Park [13], who shows that the proposed algorithm performs especially well on large flow-shop problems in both the static and dynamic sequencing environments.},

@article{Tseng09,
	Abstract = {Traditionally, the permutation flowshop scheduling problem (PFSP) was with the criterion of minimizing makespan. The permutation flowshop scheduling problem to minimize the total flowtime has attracted more attention from researchers in recent years. In this paper, a hybrid genetic local search algorithm is proposed to solve this problem with each of both criteria. The proposed algorithm hybridizes the genetic algorithm and a novel local search scheme that combines two local search methods: the Insertion Search (IS) and the Insertion Search with Cut-and-Repair (ISCR). It employs the genetic algorithm to do the global search and two local search methods to do the local search. Two local search methods play different roles in the search process. The Insertion Search is responsible for searching a small neighborhood while the Insertion Search with Cut-and-Repair is responsible for searching a large neighborhood. Furthermore, the orthogonal-array-based crossover operator is designed to enhance the GA's capability of intensification. The experimental results show the advantage of combining the two local search methods. The performance of the proposed hybrid genetic algorithm is very competitive. For the PFSP with the total flowtime criterion, it improved 66 out of the 90 current best solutions reported in the literature in short-term search and it also improved all the 20 current best solutions reported in the literature in long-term search. For the PFSP with the makespan criterion, the proposed algorithm also outperforms the other three methods recently reported in the literature.},

@article{Zhang09,
	Abstract = {In this paper, a HGA (hybrid genetic algorithm) is proposed for permutation flowshop scheduling problems (PFSP) with total flowtime minimization, which are known to be NP-hard. One of the chromosomes in the initial population is constructed by a suitable heuristic and the others are yielded randomly. An artificial chromosome is generated by a weighted simple mining gene structure, with which a new crossover operator is presented. Additionally, two effective heuristics are adopted as local search to improve all generated chromosomes in each generation. The HGA is compared with one of the most effective heuristics and a recent meta-heuristic on 120 benchmark instances. Experimental results show that the HGA outperforms the other two algorithms for all cases. Furthermore, HGA obtains 115 best solutions for the benchmark instances, 92 of which are newly discovered.},

	Abstract = {{A method is presented to approximate optimally an n -dimensional discrete probability distribution by a product of second-order distributions, or the distribution of the first-order tree dependence. The problem is to find an optimum set of n - 1 first order dependence relationship among the n variables. It is shown that the procedure derived in this paper yields an approximation of a minimum difference in information. It is further shown that when this procedure is applied to empirical observations from an unknown distribution of tree dependence, the procedure is the maximum-likelihood estimate of the distribution.}},
